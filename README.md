<div class="markdown prose w-full break-words dark:prose-invert light"><h1>Project Name: Mask Detection</h1><h2>Overview</h2><p>Mask Detection is a machine learning project that detects whether people are wearing masks or not in real-time using computer vision techniques. The project can be used in various settings, such as hospitals, public transport, and airports, to ensure that people follow safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.</p><h2>Features</h2><ul><li>Real-time mask detection: The system can detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using a webcam or a video stream.</li><li>High accuracy: The model has been trained on a large dataset of masked and unmasked faces, resulting in a high accuracy rate of detection.</li><li>User-friendly interface: The system has a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with and adjust settings.</li></ul><h2>How to Use</h2><p>To use the Mask Detection project, follow these steps:</p><ol><li>Install the required libraries and dependencies (see installation section)</li><li>Run the script using your preferred method (e.g., command-line interface, IDE)</li><li>Provide a video stream or use your computer's webcam to capture video frames</li><li>The system will detect whether people are wearing masks or not in real-time and display the results on the screen</li></ol><h2>Installation</h2><ol><li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/mask-detection.git</code></li><li>Install the required libraries: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li><li>Download the pre-trained model weights: [LINK TO MODEL WEIGHTS]</li><li>Place the model weights in the <code>model</code> directory</li><li>Run the script using your preferred method</li></ol><h2>Credits</h2><p>This project was developed by [YOUR NAME] as part of [INSTITUTION NAME]'s machine learning course.
