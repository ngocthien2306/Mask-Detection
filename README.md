  <h1>Project Name: Mask Detection</h1>
  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>Mask Detection is a machine learning project that detects whether people are wearing masks or not in real-time using computer vision techniques. The project can be used     in various settings, such as hospitals, public transport, and airports, to ensure that people follow safety protocols during the COVID-19 pandemic.
  </p>
  <h2>Features</h2>
  <ul>
    <li>Real-time mask detection: The system can detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time using a webcam or a video stream.</li>
    <li>High accuracy: The model has been trained on a large dataset of masked and unmasked faces, resulting in a high accuracy rate of detection.</li>
    <li>User-friendly interface: The system has a simple and intuitive user interface, making it easy for users to interact with and adjust settings.</li>
  </ul>
  <h2>How to Use</h2>
  <p>To use the Mask Detection project, follow these steps:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Install the required libraries and dependencies (see installation section)</li>
    <li>Run the script using your preferred method (e.g., command-line interface, IDE)</li>
    <li>Provide a video stream or use your computer's webcam to capture video frames</li>
    <li>The system will detect whether people are wearing masks or not in real-time and display the results on the screen</li>
    </ol>
    <h2>Installation</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>Clone the repository: <code>git clone https://github.com/ngocthien2306/mask-detection.git</code></li>
      <li>Install the required libraries: <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code></li>
