        <h1>Dataset Name: Mask Detection Dataset</h1>
        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>The Mask Detection Dataset is a collection of images that are categorized into two classes: images with
            people wearing masks and images with people not wearing masks. The dataset is intended for use in training
            machine learning models to detect whether a person is wearing a mask or not in real-time.</p>
        <h2>Features</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Contains ~29K images in total, with 14K7 images of people wearing masks and 14K3 images of people
                not wearing masks.</li>
            <li>Images were collected from various sources, including social media, news articles, and online databases.
            </li>
            <li>Images are in JPG format and have a resolution of 224 x 224 pixels.</li>
            <li>Images are labeled with either 'mask' or 'no mask' to indicate whether the person in the image is
                wearing a mask or not.</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Usage</h2>
        <p>To use this dataset for training a mask detection model, follow these steps:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Download the dataset from https://drive.google.com/file/d/1vLF_50e8uctmMNEIMEeO70zV3ELSPpkm/view?usp=sharing.</li>
            <li>Extract the dataset to a local directory on your machine.</li>
            <li>Load the data using your preferred data loading library or framework (e.g. TensorFlow, PyTorch).</li>
            <li>Preprocess the data as needed (e.g. resize the images, perform normalization, etc.).</li>
            <li>Use the preprocessed data to train your machine learning model.</li>
        </ol>
